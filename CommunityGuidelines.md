## TIC-80 Community Guidelines

We welcome everyone on the TIC-80 community, regardless of age and programming level, unless they are not following these guidelines. Help us keep your, our, and other's properties safe by following these Community Guidelines:
### Be respectful.
We are all different. Try not to distrupt other people's rights.
### Don't place strong violence in-game.
Do not place adult content, especially strong violence or strong language, in a TIC-80 game. This would be too inappropriate content. **The violence and bad language level should be between none to minimally strong.**
### Keep personal info private.
Do not share emails, DOBs (dates of births), people's ages, and do not link to chats except on encrypted secure websites.
### Be friendly.
It is important that all of our user generated content has no content that is only suitable for adults. If anything on TIC-80 you find looks too inappropriate for under 18s, please let us know.
